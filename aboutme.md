## TL;DR Interest in sports has hooked him into the realm of sports analytics and learning more about computing and dealing with big data.
David Nadel is a Freshman student currently enrolled at Allegheny College who is interested in majoring in Computer Science. He grew up in Short Hills, New Jersey with two siblings: Eric and Lauren. Both of his siblings have been unconditionally supportive and helpful in his childhood and teenage years. Some of the things that David enjoys to do include playing basketball and working out, listening to music, and playing his guitar. Currently at Allegheny College, David is engaged in many activities and clubs. He is currently a member of the Hillel Club, Club Soccer Team, and a pledge brother of the social fraternity "Phi Gamma Delta". In addition, he plays pickup basketball at the Wise Center.  

His interest in computers started when he was about four years old and his brother was in his junior high years. One Saturday afternoon during the summer he went up to his brother's room and saw him zoned into the game he was playing on his computer. The game Command & Conquer: Yuri's Revenge soon became an addiction for David. Furthermore, David would play games on Candystand.com and Miniclip.com. In addition to computer gaming, David's sister introduced him to Dance Dance Revolution on the PlayStation 2. He and his sister would have competitions to see who got the best score for each song on the game.

David's interest in computer science was influenced by his father who suggested to him that his love for video and computer games could be further applied into a career. Also, seeing his son constantly crunch numbers on basketball players and their individual statistics sparked an idea that maybe his son should look to work with computers. David has shown a dedicated interest in learning more about statistical analysis by looking up different people in the field such as Nate Silver, reading a book on basketball analytics, following people on Twitter, and actively researching programs.
