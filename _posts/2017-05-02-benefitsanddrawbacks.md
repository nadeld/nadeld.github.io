During this semester I used GitHub and Markdown to publish articles on my website. I developed a lot of knowledge using GitHub to create repositories and Reveal.js as a template to create the two presentations I gave on Twitch and Pirating. I learned a lot about writing in markdown by writing my articles. In addition, Sagan, the teaching assistant, and my peers helped teach me some neat tricks to design my presentations, embed hyperlinks, and customize the layout of my website. One of my peers went as far as helping me incorporate a GIF into one of my Twitch presentation's slides. While it takes time to learn all the tricks, the internet provides so much information on how to use Markdown. I found it very satisfying when I learned how to properly cite an image in my article using Markdown.      

Some of the advantages I found by using GitHub is the ability to fork another user's repository. For my presentations, I found it fascinating that I could use someone else's presentation as a template to customize my own original presentation in Reveal.js. Another element of GitHub that I really liked was the ability to raise an issue on someone else's repository. I remember earlier in the semester I posted an issue on his website's repository and he quickly fixed it. I think this process is a smooth and user-friendly way of communicating with another user. In addition, the GUI is very organized and easy to navigate. Lastly, I do like that Markdown is already implemented into GitHub. While I really liked GitHub for the above reasons, I definitely noticed some drawbacks. When first using GitHub there is a steep learning curve. At first, I was very confused as to what I was doing and had yet to fully understand what a repository even was. Also, everything that is posted on GitHub can be seen publicly by anyone. Personally, I like some privacy and manage who gets to see what similar to how Facebook lets you change privacy settings. One thing that I would like to see GitHub add to their website is a chat bar similar to Slack.
