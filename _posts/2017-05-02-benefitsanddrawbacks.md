During this semester I used GitHub and Markdown to publish articles on my website. I had a lot of experience using GitHub to create repositories and Reveal.js as a template to create the two presentations I gave on Twitch and Pirating. I learned a lot about writing in markdown by writing my articles. In addition, Sagan, the teaching assistant, and my peers helped teach me some neat tricks to design my presentations, embed hyperlinks, and customize the layout of my website.     

Some of the advantages I found by using GitHub is the ability to fork another user's repository. For my presentations, I found it fascinating that I could use someone else's presentation as a template to customize my own original presentation in Reveal.js. Another element of GitHub that I really liked was the ability to raise an issue on someone else's repository. I remember earlier in the semester I posted an issue on his website's repository and he quickly fixed it. I think this process is a smooth and user-friendly way of communicating with another user.

While I really liked GitHub for the above reasons, I definitely noticed some drawbacks.
