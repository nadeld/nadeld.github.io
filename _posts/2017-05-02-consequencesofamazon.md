## TL;DR Amazon, while making shopping easier and more accessible than ever, has created a monopoly that poses the threat of competing business going bankrupt.

I am not going to lie I use Amazon for more than half of my shopping. With Amazon Prime, there is a plethora of discounts and benefits for the shopper such as free two-day shipping, 20% off newly-release video games, access to Amazon streaming services, and even benefits for other services such as Twitch. Amazon grants Prime members with a free Twitch Prime membership that gives members free in-game content every month, ad-free viewing, and a free subscription every month. As a constant user of Twitch, these perks are very beneficial and save me a decent chunk of money. Last week, I redeemed my free NBA 2K 75,000 Visual Currency Code which helped me build my MyTeam. This saved me $20 that I did not have to pay because I am an Amazon Prime member. For a gamer like me, Amazon does everything that I need at my fingertips. However, I often forget to realize that it may be affecting businesses such as my father's. So I face a dilemma between using Amazon to buy my product's or requiring a little bit more effort by going to the mall.


While Amazon is a go to source for everything shopping related there is one major drawback. That drawback is that it costs many middle class Americans jobs. Essentially, it creates a monopoly in the industry as local companies such as GameStop, BestBuy, and Target have to compete with the biggest online shopping retailer in the world. Also while Twitch Prime gives its user's access to Twitch streams without having to watch a single advertisement, this hurts the Twitch streamer who is trying to make a living themselves. Moreover, Twitch is revolutionizing gaming by augmenting online chatting and streaming games to further social interaction. Another drawback of consumers being able to buy all of their needs online is that is encourages people to be lazy and not get out of the house. People need exercise as this can affect their attitude and motivation to work at their jobs. Leeds Metropolitan University conducted a study to examine how exercise during the day can affect workers' performance (HBR). The study showed that on days when employees visited the gym, they could manage their time more effectively, be more efficient, and have better interactions with their colleagues (HBR). Based off of this study we can come to conclusion that jobs need to have a gym or place to work within the company itself.

Similar to YouTubers and how they cannot control who watches their videos, local businesses have the same right to complain as they have no control over a company like Amazon which is ruling the industry. One similarity from a previous article I wrote and how it compares to local businesses is talking about how small YouTubers are not given the chance as more popular celebrities overshadow them. For example, a small YouTuber could produce high quality content but when a user searches for content similar to that video it will not ever be seen or in other words fall in YouTube void.

While small businesses are being hurt the most, popular department stores such as Macy's, Gap, and Kohl's stocks have all fallen in the past year (Businessinsider). "Internet retailers (led by Amazon) have added $27.8 billion to their apparel revenue since 2005, while department stores have lost $29.6 billion" (Businessinsider). The reason this is happening is because Amazon and other online retailers have extended their business to the fashion apparel. Additionally, studies anticipate that department stores will only consist of "just 7% of the total US apparel market in 2020 versus 11% today and 26% in 2005" (Businessinsider). This is discouraging because as Amazon pushes toward automation, consumers will miss out on going to a store and getting that interaction between employee and consumer.

Some ways we can prevent Amazon from impeding local businesses from growing is government involvement. This means the government has the right to impose a tax on all Amazon products. For example, the government has proposed the Marketplace Fairness Act which is a bill that would "let states compel online retailers to collect sales tax no matter where they are located" (HuffingtonPost). I think this bill would definitely help a lot of businesses out and give them an opportunity to provide to the consumer since buyers can avoid the local sales tax. Also since Amazon is likely to sit a top the industry for a while, Amazon could look to extend its business by teaming up with United Parcel Service (UPS), FedEx, and DHL. For example, Amazon can "sell its shipping services to others once its capacity is large enough" (Usnews). Another example of Amazon teaming up with other businesses is during early 2016 Amazon and Wells Fargo offered discounted student loans to Amazon Prime Student members. Another solution is that mom and pop stores can join Amazon as a seller and sell their stuff online although at the cost of $.99 per item sold plus additional selling fees. Lastly brick and mortar stores can sell their products for less. One reason I think small business such as in the clothing industry are struggling is because of the lack of creativity in clothes. Since buyers do not like the style of clothes at mom and pop stores, they would rather buy clothes that are cheaper on Amazon.

So ultimately small business face the behemoth in Amazon and Amazon has now signs of slowing down. In 2016, the number of people who hopped on the Amazon Prime train increased 35% to 54 million (CNN). Also during holidays 2015, "two-hundred million more items received free shipping" than the previous year (CNBC). In addition, a research analyst at JPMorgan believes that "physical store locations" will "be cut by a third over the next five to 10 years" (CNBC). Furthermore, since Amazon collects sales tax from many states, they can use that money to fund local warehouses or shipping centers which will make shipping faster 'next-day delivery' (Slate). In other words this means that Prime members will get their products delivered to their house or apartment in a day rather than two days.
