## TL;DR Amazon, while making shopping easier and more accessible than ever, poses the threat of employees losing jobs.

I am not going to lie I use Amazon for more than half of my shopping. With Amazon Prime, there is a plethora of discounts and benefits for the shopper such as free two-day shipping, 20% off newly-release video games, and even benefits for other services such as Twitch. Amazon grants Prime members with a free Twitch Prime membership that gives members free in-game content every month, ad-free viewing, and a free subscription every month. As a constant user of Twitch, these perks are very beneficial and save me a decent chunk of money. Last week, I redeemed my free NBA 2K 75,000 Visual Currency Code which helped me build my MyTeam. This saved me $20 that I did not have to pay because I am an Amazon Prime member. For a gamer like me, Amazon does everything that I need at my fingertips.


While Amazon is a go to source for everything shopping related there is one major drawback. That drawback is that it costs many middle class Americans jobs. Essentially, it creates a monopoly in the industry as local companies such as GameStop, BestBuy, and Target have to compete with the biggest online shopping retailer in the world. Also while Twitch Prime gives its user's access to Twitch streams without having to watch a single advertisement, this hurts the Twitch streamer who is trying to make a living themselves.
