## TL;DR Amazon, while making shopping easier and more accessible than ever, poses the threat of employees losing jobs.

I am not going to lie I use Amazon for more than half of my shopping. With Amazon Prime, there is a plethora of discounts and benefits for the shopper such as free two-day shipping, 20% off newly-release video games, and even benefits for other services such as Twitch. Amazon grants Prime members with a free Twitch Prime membership that gives members free in-game content every month, ad-free viewing, and a free subscription every month. As a constant user of Twitch, these perks are very beneficial and save me a decent chunk of money. Last week, I redeemed my free NBA 2K 75,000 Visual Currency Code which helped me build my MyTeam. This saved me $20 that I did not have to pay because I am an Amazon Prime member. For a gamer like me, Amazon does everything that I need at my fingertips.


While Amazon is a go to source for everything shopping related there is one major drawback. That drawback is that it costs many middle class Americans jobs. Essentially, it creates a monopoly in the industry as local companies such as GameStop, BestBuy, and Target have to compete with the biggest online shopping retailer in the world. Also while Twitch Prime gives its user's access to Twitch streams without having to watch a single advertisement, this hurts the Twitch streamer who is trying to make a living themselves. Moreover, Twitch is revolutionizing gaming by augmenting online chatting and streaming games to further social interaction. Another drawback of consumers being able to buy all of their needs online is that is encourages people to be lazy and not get out of the house. People need exercise as this can affect their attitude and motivation to work at their jobs. Leeds Metropolitan University conducted a study to examine how exercise during the day can affect workers' performance (HBR). The study showed that on days when employees visited the gym, they could manage their time more effectively, be more efficient, and have better interactions with their colleagues (HBR). Based off of this study we can come to conclusion that jobs need to have a gym or place to work within the company itself.

Similar to YouTubers and how they cannot control who watches their videos, local businesses have the same right to complain as they have no control over a company like Amazon ruling the industry. One similarity from a previous article I wrote and how it compares to local businesses

Some ways we can prevent Amazon from impeding local businesses from growing is government involvement. This means the government has the right to impose a tax on all Amazon products. Also since Amazon is likely to sit a top the industry for a while, Amazon could look to extend its business by teaming up with United Parcel Service(UPS), FedEx, and DHL. For example, Amazon can "sell its shipping services to others once its capacity is large enough" (Usnews). Another example of Amazon teaming up with other businesses is during early 2016 Amazon and Wells Fargo offered discounted student loans to Amazon Prime Student members.
