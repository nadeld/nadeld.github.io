## TL;DR Gaming keeps growing in ways that can get people together from all across the world and since gaming is only getting more popular, a social-interactive hub creates unique opportunities.

When kids come home from school on a Friday afternoon, their first instinct is to take their mind off that end of the week exam and watch television or play video games. In other words, the average teenager does not plan to study on Friday night because weekends are for participating in hobbies that they did not have time for during their hectic school week. Furthermore, some students feel daily stresses not only from schoolwork but also socially, and out-letting to online gaming can postively-influence their mental and emotional health. This trend of playing video games during the weekend has influenced the rise of online video-game play on both computers and consoles.

While many play video games by themselves or cooperatively with peers, the emergence of the online gaming channel Twitch has revolutionized gaming in ways like never before. For many, the ease of communicating with other viewers and entertainment of watching others play video games is more enjoyable than actually playing the game themselves. For example, when a new game is released on Tuesday I often watch a streamer play through a decent chunk of the campaign of the game to see if I may want to purchase it. Also, sometimes I may completely skip over the game because I am so hooked on seeing the streamer play it. The abundance of Twitch streamers makes it easier than ever to decide on if I want to buy a particular game. Most importantly with the internet we are more educated about each game and so we learn how to make smart decisions financially. Another perk of live-streaming is the entertainment of observing a streamer "rage" and complain at the game. This included with the implementation of a live chat on Twitch creates a sense of audience and reaction to live streams that would not be attainable in the 1990s to the mid 2000s. Moreover, many viewers can subscribe to their favorite streamers to allow them to feel more united with the streamer and other subscribers and in effect create more friendships. Gaming will continue to evolve with new ways to play and watch as we see with the connection between streamer and viewer on Twitch.

While Twitch is one of the biggest websites for gamers, another social-interactive hub is YouTube, which provides many benefits for gamers like me. For example, when gamers face difficulties in video games they seek the many tutorials and guides that consist on YouTube. A personal experience where I had difficulty in a video game was most recently with the game Dark Souls II. Dark Souls II is a cryptic game that does not explain the controls or what the player has to do. During one of the boss fights, I looked up a YouTube video on how to get past the Ancient Dragon boss, which is very hard to defeat because of its unpredictable attacks. In addition, a comment section and ability to directly message the uploader makes it helpful for the gamer. Some gamers, while willing to accept a difficult challenge, would rather see how a game's story plays out. Spending countless hours dying to a boss can frustrate players and thus the abundance of videos on YouTube can make the player feel at ease by allowing them to get over that frustrating level. Other ways internet services have benefited the gamers exist on consoles with the ability to share screenshots, clips, and connect via party chat.


As a constant user of internet sites such as YouTube and Twitch, the ability to communicate with others about a game that I am currently playing, creates a sense of community and satisfaction in knowing that gamers all around the world are with me on this journey too. I cannot speak to what it was like in early gaming history, but from speaking with others who gamed during the early years expressed that they had to rely solely on themselves or their friends who had the game. Nowadays, there is always a group, clan, and community to be a part of. Making what was once a fairly anti-social activity into a social activity has given a sense of comfort and promotes teamwork for gamers who use the internet for their gaming desires.
