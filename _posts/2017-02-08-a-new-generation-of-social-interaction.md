## TL;DR Gaming keeps growing in ways that can get people together from all across the world and since gaming is only getting more popular, an interactive hub creates unique opportunities.
When kids come home from school on a Friday afternoon, their first instinct is to take their mind off that end of the week exam and put it on watching television or playing  video games. In other words, the average teenager does not plan to study on Friday night because weekends are for participating in hobbies that they did not have time for during their hectic school week. This trend of playing video games all weekend has influenced the rise of video game play on both computers and consoles.

While many play video games by themselves or cooperatively with peers, the emergence of the online gaming channel Twitch has revolutionized gaming in ways like never before. For many, the ease of communicating with other viewers and entertainment of watching others play video games is more enjoyable than actually playing the game themselves.
