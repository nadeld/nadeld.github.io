## TL;DR Gaming keeps growing in ways that can get people together from all across the world and since gaming is only getting more popular, a social-interactive hub creates unique opportunities.

When kids come home from school on a Friday afternoon, their first instinct is to take their mind off that end of the week exam and put it on watching television or playing  video games. In other words, the average teenager does not plan to study on Friday night because weekends are for participating in hobbies that they did not have time for during their hectic school week. This trend of playing video games during the weekend has influenced the rise of video game play on both computers and consoles.

While many play video games by themselves or cooperatively with peers, the emergence of the online gaming channel Twitch has revolutionized gaming in ways like never before. For many, the ease of communicating with other viewers and entertainment of watching others play video games is more enjoyable than actually playing the game themselves. For example, I personally use Twitch and find it as a source of entertainment. It is especially entertaining to watch a streamer "rage" or fail and complain at the game. The implementation of a live chat on Twitch creates a sense of audience and reaction that would not be attainable in the 1990s to the mid 2000s. Gaming will continue to evolve with new ways to play and watch as we see with the connection between streamer and viewer.

While Twitch is one of the biggest websites for gamers, another social-interactive hub in YouTube, provides many benefits for gamers. For example, when gamers face difficulties in video games they seek the many tutorials and guides that consist on YouTube. In addition, a comment section and ability to directly message the uploader makes it more enjoyable on the gamer. Some gamers, while accept a difficult challenge in gaming, would rather see how a game's story plays out than spending countless hours dying to a boss and thus with the abundance of videos on YouTube can feel at ease knowing that they now know how to get over that frustrating level. Games used to be incredibly difficult and players would get so turned off by the game that they would never touch the game again.
