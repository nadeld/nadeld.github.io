## TL;DR

It is important for students during their junior and senior year of high school to develop passions and interests. This sparks intrinsic motivation and makes them value what their learning rather than just memorizing notes for an exam but allow freedom in how they want to learn. Boarding schools have started to implement hands on experiences outside of the classroom. We need our students to get out in the field to learn rather than just sit in the classroom as it can be boring and also affect their intrinsic motivation.

We need to take away grades from universities. One school that has practices this is University of California, Redlands.
