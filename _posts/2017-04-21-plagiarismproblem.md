## TL;DR Plagiarism can be completely eradicated if students are graded on their engagement in the classroom. (genuine interest)

It is important for students during their junior and senior year of high school to develop passions and interests. This sparks intrinsic motivation and makes them value their learning rather than just memorizing notes for an exam but allow freedom in how they want to learn. Boarding schools have started to implement hands on experiences outside of the classroom. We need our students to get out in the field to learn rather than just sit in the classroom as it can be boring and also affects their intrinsic motivation and thus their outlook on school. In my opinion, student participation should be weighted more heavily as employers are looking for candidates who are driven and genuinely care about what they do. While I think papers are an important component of one's education, I do feel that exams and quizzes discourage students as they put a burden on their social and emotional health. For example, at many of the rigorous colleges and universities in the United States  are infamous for the student suicide rate.

The Academic Disciplinary Board at many colleges and universities would probably object that grades should be replaced with an effort and participation check-mark system, but I argue students would be more motivated to work harder and value their education. Especially since there are many students that have demanding schedules both academically and extracurically. The national suicide rate among 15 to 24 year old has "increased modestly but steadily since 2007: from 9.6 death per 100,000 to 11.1, in 2013" (Nytimes). In addition, the presence of kids with psychological problems has increrased at an incredible 13 percent from 2013 to 2015 (NYTimes).

One's intrinsic motivation can be threatened by having to keep up with people who are always getting grades. For example, getting a good job can be very competitive especially in fields such as a doctor and an engineer. At Ivy League schools, many students feel pressured to compete with their fellow colleagues which also affects their emotional health and lack of sleep. Many parents also force their kids to attend "elite" colleges which also puts added pressure on them to succeed and live up to these high expectations. Furthermore, increased technology has allowed parents to view their student's constantly updated grades online and creates additional pressure for students.

We need to take away grades from universities. One school that has practices this is University of California, Redlands and Sierra Lawrence College. Secondly, we need to implement games into classrooms. John Shindler, a faculty member at California State University, Los Angeles, has expressed that games can "raise the level of interest and excitement while accomplishing the same degree of content processing" (Thinkfun). Technology has made it possible for different ways of learning curriculum, and games would keep kids engaged in the classroom. Last semester I took a Freshman Seminar in game theory and I studied how gamification can help motivate consumers to buy that company's products. For example, Footlocker's VIP club gives the customer perks such as discounts on shoes and gift cards after every $100 they spend.
