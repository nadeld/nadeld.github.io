## TL;DR Plagiarism can be completely eradicated if students are graded on their engagement in the classroom. (genuine interest)

It is important for students during their junior and senior year of high school to develop passions and interests. This sparks intrinsic motivation and makes them value what their learning rather than just memorizing notes for an exam but allow freedom in how they want to learn. Boarding schools have started to implement hands on experiences outside of the classroom. We need our students to get out in the field to learn rather than just sit in the classroom as it can be boring and also affect their intrinsic motivation and thus their outlook on school. In my opinion, student participation should be weighted more heavily as employers are looking for candidates who are driven and genuinely care about they do. While I think papers are an ultra-important component of one's education, I do feel that exams and quizzes discourage students as they put a burden on their social and emotional health. For example, at many of the rigorous colleges and universities in the United States they have are infamous for the student suicide rate.

We need to take away grades from universities. One school that has practices this is University of California, Redlands and Sierra Lawrence College.
