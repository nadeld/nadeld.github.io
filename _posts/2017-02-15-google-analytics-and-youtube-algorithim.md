## TL;DR Emerging YouTubers are not given the chance because YouTube's algorithm favors the bigger, more popular YouTubers.

If a person wants to find a way to make a living off a YouTube channel, they will find that the first several videos they put out will often vanish in the YouTube void. It takes a creative plan and tons of determination to even have the ability to monetize videos. While YouTube is a great source for people viewing content such as sports highlights, funny videos, and video game playthroughs, trying to upload something creative and unique can be quite a tough task. Even though a YouTuber might have a large viewer base and many people watching their videos, the ability to use Google Extensions such as AdBlockPlus, hurt YouTuber's who are trying to make a living off their videos.
