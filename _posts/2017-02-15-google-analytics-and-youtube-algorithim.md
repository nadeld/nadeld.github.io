## TL;DR Emerging YouTubers are not given the chance because YouTube's algorithm favors the bigger, more popular YouTubers.

If a person wants to find a way to make a living off a YouTube channel, they will find that the first several videos they put out will often vanish into the YouTube void. It takes a creative plan and tons of determination to even have the ability to monetize one's videos. While YouTube is a great source for people viewing content such as sports highlights, funny videos, and video game playthroughs; trying to upload something creative and unique can be quite a tough task. Even though a YouTuber might have a large viewer base and many people watching their videos, the ability to use Google Extensions such as AdBlockPlus, hurt YouTuber's who are trying to make a living off their videos. Many viewers use adblock because they do not want to waste 20 seconds for each video they watch and this 20 seconds is ironic because if they really enjoy watching their youtuber you would think they would sit through the ad to support them. Combined with the fact that there are over 2,000 channels with at least one million subscribers, creates the grueling task of having to stand out over the competition.

There are many YouTuber's who have the charisma and personality to attract a wide and diverse fan base who put the time and effort into each and every video and with the challenges they face such as with false copyright strikes, decline in ad growth, and committment to producing quality content in the uploader's videos. (look up challenges that youtubers face) One particular YouTuber, DSPGaming, aka DarksydePhil, finds a way to make a living of YouTube by uploading game playthroughs, and other vlog series such as Ask the King, DSP Tries It, and Hateful Truths. DSP has been a very successful Youtuber for 7 years but due to the negligence of YouTube's front desk he is currently having a tough time paying his bills. Just this week he put out an hour long video on how Google/Youtube ad revenue issues have posed a serious threat to his business. In the month of February which is supposed to be prime time for getting increased revenue, turned out to hurt DSP in that the analytics say YouTube/Google ads lost profitability, and therefore DSP is losing a whopping 35% less money compared to the previous month January. In addition , many other popular YouTuber's such as Boogie2988, Videogamedunkey, and ETC Show are also suffering financially from Googles Ad Services. In particular, Boogie2988 claims that he is losing out on a lot of money because his videos have been flagged for "not ad-friendly".

One solution to prevent this whole ad issue for uploaders who rely on these ads in order to live a suitable life is the YouTube service called YouTube Red. YouTube Red is a paid-subscription $9.99 per month service that provides many benefits such as ad-free videos. If people take advantage of this service, it will ensure that YouTube creators make money and continuing making quality content. Furthermore, Google Chrome's Web Store needs to remove any AdBlock services. Another alternative could be to introduce a Donation button for YouTubers or in order to watch an uploader's content one would have to pay a $5 fee to subscribe and get access to their content.

YouTube is an extremely demanding job, and while other jobs might be demanding too, a typical office job has the weekends as breaks. A YouTuber does not have as much free time since their salary is not fixed and is directly affected by people watching their videos. So when there is Ad Revenue problems on YouTube people have a right to complain because they could have many people watch their videos but they are not receiving the proper credit for deleivering the hard work they put into their videos. Moreover, The exponential growth in terms of million subscriber channels will most likely continue and this will result in more stress for YouTuber's. It is also important to note that over half of total channels on YouTube receive less than 500 page views per video and only 0.33% get more than one million views. Based of this growing trend, the average viewer will continue to be provided with so much content and benefit them in ways that unfortunately uploaders who do YouTube as a living a complete opposite feeling. It is imperative that YouTubers never give up due the current issues plauging the website. One reason for optimism is that thousands of channels are making six figure salaries.
